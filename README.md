# Da Boker Pot

MSVC/MFC C++ code for analyzing and playing. It looses money in real games as it has no sensible logic for when to raise, fold, bluff, etc.
A modern implementation would drop the MFC parts and replace it with Generic Win32 API calls and probably use a neural network for analyzing
and playing well.

This software might only be legal to run for research purposes.

## How to use

1. Start and log in to a (Win32 Native, fairly straight-forward to port to a browser implementation) poker application.

2. Maximize the window, or drag it to the top-left corner of the screen.

3. Sit at a Seven Card Stud table using free money (fairly easy to port to Hold'em).

4. Start the program.

5. Enjoy.
